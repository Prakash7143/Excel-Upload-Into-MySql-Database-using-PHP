This is a simple Excel Upload System using Php & MySql.

1. Import the SQL Database "excelfile".
2. Then run the file in your browser.
3. Upload the present excel file "UploadThisDemo.xlxs".
4. Now again try to uplaod this file it will give "File already exists" message.
5. This is coded in such a way that prevents duplicate entries into table.
6. Please note that category which you will be writing must be the one which is present in "questionnaire_category" table. The format in which the present Excel file is there you create your excel file in the same format starting from cell A to G.

Happy Coding...
Thanks....
